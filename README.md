# Website Architect Tips
see [EWB Wiki](http://cuewb.org/wiki/)

## Updating the header/footer
To update any information in the header or footer, you must update the information in *every* index.html file. This includes the home, about, projects, and resources page - which means that if you change something in one page, you have to change it everywhere (4 times in total).

## Updating meeting times
The meeting times are located in the following locations:

1. Footer of the main website (must be changed 4 times...see above)
2. Footer of project website
3. Top of about page on main website
4. Section of project page on main website
5. Footer of donate page on main website

----
## Updating contact information
Updating contact information is fairly simple. Here are the places to keep in mind:

* About page on main website (EBoard information)
* Project pages (PM information)

----
## Updating photos
Be sure to compress photos as needed when uploading them to the website, and to crop them to the appropriate dimensions so that no parts of the pictures are left out. Typically photos should be in the 200Kb - 1Mb range. The following website is useful in compressing photos to a specified size: https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/compress-image-size.php.
